# SOOL - Simple/Sophisticated/Static Object Oriented Language

SOOL is designed to be an othoganally complete normalized semantic superset of all the major Object Oriented Languages. 

This old description of SOOL is a written using what I call an *example syntax style* that gives example snippets of the syntax using ellipsis as an elision mechanism for the syntax.
